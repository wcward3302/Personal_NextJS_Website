            <p>As the name of the site implies, I'm Will! So far I've been a bit of a nomad, traveling around our great nation, living in Colorado, 
                Kansas, Missouri, louisiana, and now Florida. I recently graduated from FGCU as Summa Cum Laude with a 3.9GPA with a degree in 
                software engineering, but my growth will not stop there, as I venture into professional development. I have always been a team player,
                willing to wear whatever hat is necessary, learning on the fly if need be. </p>
